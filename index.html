         <h1>Minor Dive into The Harmonic Expanse</h2>
            Oh no Emma talks about her worldbuilding (again)
      </header>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      For this particular assignment, I've decided to talk about one of the aspects of a world I've been working on for
      a
      TTRPG (Tabletop RPG, similar to Dungeons and Dragons). The universe itself is called Black Space, a near-endless
      void plane that is largely anarchical by nature. There are certain overhead rules that have been agreed upon by
      those possessing large amounts of power compared to the rest, however for the most part societies remain largely
      self-governing.

      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <div class="overview">
         
         <div class="siphanthotoa">
            <img id="orbWadImage" src="images\Siphtanthotoa.png" width="500" height="500">
            <p>Siphanthotoa, the ruler of the Harmonic Expanse. The nodes on its body feature a 20ft radius at the
               minimum.
            </p>
         </div>
         <p>
            The Harmonic Expanse is one of the largest regions found within Black Space, surpassed only by the Twilight
            Frontier and Tchena-Locta. In addition to boasting significant size, the Harmonic Expanse is also considered
            to
            be
            among Black Space's more populated territories as well. Siphanthotoa's presence alone often discourages most
            entities from trespassing within the region. As a result, the Harmonic Expanse boasts a large population of
            sentient species, many of which are often refugees fleeing the destruction wrought by Siphanthotoa's rivals.
         </p>
         <p>
            Despite the Lustrous Resonance's presence dissuading most external attackers, residents of the Harmonic
            Expanse
            are far from safe. Siphanthotoa itself is infamous for being incredibly destructive, occasionally emerging
            from
            its lair
            deep within
            the Lustrous Abyss to lay waste to its surroundings. The aftermath of such destruction usually sees
            the population of the Harmonic Expanse reduced to half of what it was prior to Siphanthotoa's emergence.
            Thankfully, these attacks are quite sparse (occuring approximately once every 100,000 years), and the
            rumblings
            that foreshadow an attack occur days prior to the actual event. Even a couple of days can be too little
            time,
            however. Stragglers that fail to flee the region before Siphanthotoa begins its rampage are met with a
            sudden
            and deadly end. Their bodies begin to freeze rapidly, turning to ice in a matter of seconds before
            shattering
            from The Lustrous Resonance's powerful vibrations. Anything that remains intact after this flash
            freezing will rise as a Frequency, sealing the individual's fate as a servant to Siphanthotoa until their
            untimely
            destruction.
         </p>
         <p>
            Siphtanthotoa's Frequencies pose another threat within the region (and occasionally beyond the Harmonic
            Expanse
            as well). They are known to scour Black Space, serving as scouts and information gatherers for the Lustrous
            Resonance. Despite being perfectly capable of standard communication with most other species, Frequencies
            prefer to interact in ways that often confuse targets and conceal intentions. This, combined with their
            naturally hostile demenor towards non-frequency individuals means that encounters with them should be
            avoided
            whenever possible.
         </p>

         <p>
            Past all of the dangers however, lies a vibrant ecosystem and way of existence that cannot be found anywhere
            else in Black Space. Frequencies, despite their hostile nature towards other sentient creatures, deligently
            tend
            to both the natural and societal elements of The Harmonic Expanse. Many have questioned this degree of attentiveness.

         <h2>Major Subregions</h2>

         <h3>The Lustrous Abyss</h3>
         <article id="lustrousAbyssArticle">
            <P>The Lustrous Abyss is the epicenter of the Harmonic Expanse. It is within the deepest recesses of this
               region that The Lustrous
               Resonance dwells most of the time, emerging once a millenia to inflict mindless devastation upon its
               surroundings.
            </P>
            <p>
               Entering the Lustrous Abyss is surprisingly easy compared to the rest of the Harmonic Expanse. The
               borders of the subregion are unguarded with no extra precautions, allowing one to
               cross into the Abyss without being required
               to seek a dedicated crossing point. Behind this eaily-traversible barrier however, lies a world of
               nightmares never seen before.
            </p>
            <p>
               The Lustrous Abyss is hell in the most abstract sense. Unless special precautions were taken beforehand,
               entry into the region results in a complete nullification of the common senses. Many stumble through the
               region blinded, deafened, and numb to all but what Siphanthotoa desires to be percieved. Every so often,
               a wave of psychic energy sweeps the Abyss, inducing bouts of severe sensory overload to those exposed.
               Survivors of the experience often describe it as "Feeling your brain being compressed by a garbage
               compactor while simultaneously having a hot spike being driven into either side." This persistent
               bombardment of the mind is known to be so painful that one-third of those that descend into the Lustrous
               Abyss take their own lives shortly after.

         <article id="discordantBreachArticle">
            <h3>Discordant Breach</h3>
            Despite the sheer size of the Harmonic Expanse, entering into the region itself has been known to be
            surprisingly difficult. Such difficulty can be attributed to the massive subregion that lines (what is
            considered to be) the outer edges of the domain. Compared to other regions found throughout Black Space,
            there are few openings within the Discordant Breach where one can cross the barrier into the Greater
            Harmonic Expanse, and even fewer locations where
            one can make the traversal safely. Attempting to enter The Harmonic Expanse without passing through one of
            these openings will result in the entrant warping to the opposite exterior side of the region.

            <p>
               Many passageways through the Discordant Breach feature toll stations, usually where one must meet the
               demands of the owner before gaining entry. These demands can vary in both price and complexity; some
               require a small fee before granting passage, while others insist that travelers demonstrate their
               worthiness by
               completing certain tasks (some of which can be dangerous.) The most frequent variant of these tolls is an
               "official" one run by the Church of Singing Spheres. Stations run by the Church are both well-guarded and
               demand a reasonable fare to gain passage, making them among the more popular choices for travelers trying
               to pass through.

         <article id="deadMirageVoid">
            <h3>Mirage's Absence</h3>
            Mirage's Absence is suspiciously void of life compared to the rest of the domain. Fields of ice
            and rubble from destroyed celestial masses litter the region, occasionally forming ghastly shapes as they
            drift past.
            <p>
               The region is also known to be quite the popular spot for scavenging and mining operations, given the
               abundance of derelict buildings and mineral deposits amongst the floating rubble. It is because of the
               nature of these sources that have led many to believe that Mirage's Absence serves as a "dumping ground"
               of sorts for Siphanthotoa, where all of the excess matter it doesn't want to merge into the greater
               Harmonic Expanse is left to decay.
            </p>

            <p>
               In addition to the rich material deposits found within this region, it has also been rumored that a minor
               entity can be encountered here. Known as The Uncertainty (0-1-Ux-08), many have tried to seek them out in
               order to put their philosophical knowledge to the test. There doesn't seem to be a set location or time
               to which The Uncertainty can be encountered however. As a result, many wander the empty wastes of
               Mirage's Absence, hoping that one day, the entity will make itself known.
            </p>

         <h2>Notable Organizations</h2>
         <article id="singingChurchArticle">
            <h3>Church of the Singing Spheres</h3>
            <P>The primary religious body dedicated to the worship of Siphanthotoa. Found all throughout The Harmonic
               Expanse, members of The Church of Singing Spheres dedicate their lives to carrying out the wishes and
               desires of the Lustrous Resonance. Given the fact that it is difficult to determine what Siphanthotoa's
               wishes and plans are, however, the Church is often forced to utilize workaround methods of acquiring such
               insight. </P>

         <article id="tradingLeagueArticle">
            <h3>Black Space Trader's Consortium (Harmonic Expanse Branch)</h3>
            <P>
               The Black Space Trader's Consortium (or BSTC) is already well-known to be one of the wealthiest trader's
               organizations to exist, and the Harmonic Expanse Branch is no exception to this rule. Given the
               exclusivity of Siphantite within the region (combined with its high value on the market), many merchants
               have been able to monopolize the exports such such a mineral in order to achieve massive returns.
            </P>
            <p>
               Mining corporations that specialize in the extraction of siphantite frequently clash with the BSTC's
               buying and selling policies. Given the trading league's grip on the market, companies are forced to sell the 
               raw materials at nigh unsustainable rates.

         <article id="siphantiteWorkshop">
            <h3>Hadolo's Siphantite Assembly and Repair&reg;</h3>
            <P>One of many workshops that specializes in working with devices powered by the Harmonic Expanse's most
               abundant material, Hadolo's Siphantite Assembly and Repair&reg; and what they provide is often touted as
               being the best the market can offer. Whether or not these claims are true depends on the customer.</P>

            <p>
               The most notable product manufactured by Hadolo's is the siphantite battery. It was produced using its
               namesake material, as well as a special component that allows it to attempt resonation with Siphanthotoa
               regardless
               of how close the battery is. Disturbances generated by the siphantite attempting to match its creator in
               frequency are then converted to energy that can be then utilized by the devices the battery powers.
