         <h3>Discordant Breach</h3>
         Despite the sheer size of the Harmonic Expanse, entering into the region itself has been known to be
         surprisingly difficult. Such difficulty can be attributed to the massive subregion that lines (what is
         considered to be) the outer edges of the domain.
