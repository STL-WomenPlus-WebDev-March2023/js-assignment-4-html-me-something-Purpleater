      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <img class="siphanthotoa" src="images\Siphtanthotoa.png" width="500" height="500">
      <p>
         The Harmonic Expanse is one of the largest regions found within Black Space, surpassed only by the Twilight
         Frontier and Tchena-Locta. In addition to boasting significant size, the Harmonic Expanse is also considered to
         be
         among Black Space's more populated territories as well. Siphanthotoa's presence alone often discourages most
         entities from trespassing within the region. As a result, the Harmonic Expanse boasts a large population of
         sentient species, many of which are often refugees fleeing the destruction wrought by Siphanthotoa's rivals.
      </p>
      <p>
         Despite the Lustrous Resonance's presence dissuading most external attackers, residents of the Harmonic Expanse
         are far from safe. Siphanthotoa itself is infamous for being incredibly destructive, occasionally emerging from
         its lair
         deep within
         the Lustrous Abyss to lay waste to its surroundings. The aftermath of such destruction usually sees
         the population of the Harmonic Expanse reduced to half of what it was prior to Siphanthotoa's emergence.
         Thankfully, these attacks are quite sparse (occuring approximately once every 100,000 years), and the rumblings
         that foreshadow an attack occur days prior to the actual event. Even a couple of days can be too little time,
         however. Stragglers that fail to flee the region before Siphanthotoa begins its rampage are met with a sudden
         and deadly end. Their bodies begin to freeze rapidly, turning to ice in a matter of seconds before shattering
         from The Lustrous Resonance's powerful vibrations. Any part of the body that remains intact after this flash
         freezing will rise as a Frequency, sealing the owner's fate as a servant to Siphanthotoa until their untimely
         destruction.
      </p>
      <p>Siphtanthotoa's Frequencies pose another threat within the region (and occasionally beyond the Harmonic Expanse
         as well). They are known to scour Black Space, serving as scouts and information gatherers for the Lustrous
         Resonance. Despite being perfectly capable of standard communication with most other species, Frequencies
         prefer to interact in ways that often confuse targets and conceal intentions. This, combined with their
         naturally hostile demenor towards non-frequency individuals means that encounters with them should be avoided
         whenever possible. </p>

         <h2>Major Subregions</h2>
         <article id="lustrousAbyssArticle">
            <h3>The Lustrous Abyss</h3>
            <P>The Lustrous Abyss is the epicenter of the Harmonic Expanse. It is within the deepest recesses of this
               region that The Lustrous
               Resonance dwells most of the time, emerging once a millenia to inflict mindless devastation upon its
               surroundings.

         <article id="discordantBreachArticle">
            <h3>Discordant Breach</h3>
            Despite the sheer size of the Harmonic Expanse, entering into the region itself has been known to be
            surprisingly difficult. Such difficulty can be attributed to the massive subregion that lines (what is
            considered to be) the outer edges of the domain. Compared to other regions found throughout Black Space,
            there are few openings within the Discordant Breach where one can cross the barrier into the Greater
            Harmonic Expanse, and even fewer locations where
            one can make the traversal safely.

            <h3>Mirage's Absence</h3>
            Mirage's Absence is suspiciously void of life compared to the rest of the domain. Fields of ice
            and rubble from destroyed celestial masses litter the region, occasionally forming ghastly shapes as they
            drift past.

         <article id="singingChurchArticle">
            <h3>Church of the Singing Spheres</h3>
            <P>The primary religious body dedicated to the worship of Siphanthotoa. Found all throughout The Harmonic
               Expanse, members of The Church of Singing Spheres dedicate their lives to carrying out the wishes and
               desires of the Lustrous Resonance. Given the fact that it is difficult to determine what Siphanthotoa's
               wishes and plans are, however, the Church is often forced to utilize workaround methods of acquiring such
               insight. </P>

            <h3>Black Space Trader's Consortium (Harmonic Expanse Branch)</h3>
            <P>The Black Space Trader's Consortium is already well-known to be one of the wealthiest trader's
               organizations to exist, and the Harmonic Expanse Branch is no exception to this rule. Given the
               exclusivity of Siphantite within the region (combined with its high value on the market), many merchants
               have been able to monopolize the exports such such a mineral in order to achieve massive returns. </P>

            <h3>Hadolo's Siphantite Assembly and Repair&reg;</h3>

               abundant material, Hadolo's Siphantite Assembly and Repair&reg; and what they provide is often touted as
               being the best the market can offer. Whether or not these claims are true depends on the customer.</P>
